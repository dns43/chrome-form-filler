TODO's are describe as inline comments in the code itself.
Implementation strategy shoul already  be clear from where they  are.
Sometimes multiple locations need changes, so they have the same TODO MARKER

run `grep -rn TODO pages` to find where they are.

E.g. `grep -rn TODO PERSISTENT STORAGE pages/`

Current Markers are:
// TODO URL
// TODO PERSISTENT STORAGE
// TODO WORKFLOW
// TODO REVERSE KEYLOGGER
// TODO LABEL RECOGNITION ENGINE
